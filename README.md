# Temperature

## Overview:
This repository will contain all scripts used to clean and standardize the temperature data from autonomous logging devices installed in the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas. The scripts will edit raw data from HoboWave, intermediate files, and master lists of all temperature data from all sites.

## Method:
CREMP has been monitoring corals along Florida’s Coral Reef since 1996. Every active CREMP monitoring site is now paired with a temperature logger. We currently have 77 loggers recording water temperatures from Martin County to the waters of Dry Tortugas National Park - 22 in Southeast Florida, 44 in the Florida Keys, and 11 in the Dry Tortugas. Our [Unified Florida Reef Map](https://myfwc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=ea7ac98649474cb9af7a6a20c823846d) is an ArcGIS map with multiple layers - to turn on the layer showing the temperature monitoring sites, click the “Show Contents of Map” icon on the left above “Unified Florida Coral Reef Tract Map”, then check the box next to “FRT Temperature Monitoring – CREMP Sites”.  We monitor water temperatures on a variety of different reef types and depths, including hardbottom habitats, shallow forereefs, deep forereefs, and patch reefs. 

Here is the current list of sites that have either historic or ongoing temperature data available:

## Units:
Temperature is recorded in degrees Celsius (°C)
